<!-- Overview -->
## Overview
This is a starter App includes a Laravel application equipped with the required auth processes and webhooks/actions that help you to create your Salla App which works with the [Salla APIs](https://docs.salla.dev/). Your App later can be published to the [Salla App Store](https://apps.salla.sa/) and be available for installation to any of Salla [Merchants Stores](https://s.salla.sa/).

What can you use this starter App for?
* Create a Salla App from scratch, e.g. chatbot app or shipping service app or any amazing app from your idea.
* Modify/Customize any of your previous Apps in order to take the advantages given by this starter App.
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The starter App comes with an easy _1-command step_ that does the complete setup for your starter App. To be ready, you will need some prerequisites which will be listed hereafter.

### Prerequisites
-   Create a Partner account at  [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/)
-   Create your App in [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.dev/blog/create-your-first-app-on-salla-developer-portal/)

    > From your App dashbaord at [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/), you will be able to get your App's _Client ID, Client Secret Key and Webhook Secret Key_ which you will use later duraing the setup process.

-   For Laravel compatibility: `PHP >= 7.4, Composer package manager and MySql Database`
-   Install [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok): `npm install ngrok -g`
-   Other requirments: `Nodejs and npm`

That is all!

### Installation
The installation process is straightforward as you will see in the below steps.

1. In your MySql Database: **create a database** with any name for example  `laravel`.

2.  In your command line: **run** the following `create-project` composer command to create your Laravel starter App project.
```sh
composer create-project salla/laravel-start-kit {your-awesome-app}
```

The above `create-project` will take you through a step-by-step process in which you'll enter your App's _Client ID, Client Secret Key, and Webhook Secret Key_, which you can get from your App dashboard in the Partners Panel, as well as your database name, which is set to `laravel` by default.

> The step will ask you to select the authorization mode for your App, which can be [Easy or Custom mode.](#auth-modes)
> In case you selected the _Custom_ mode for your App authorization, you will need to the enter the **same callback Url you already entered in your App dashboard at the [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/)**


3. **Last step**: in your command line: **run** `php artisan serve.remote` command

![8HPj07id-2021-11-19 at 00 15 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10876587/142498178-73e13f33-8f2a-401c-b7b0-7278e282be57.gif)

Now you can open your broswer to view your App at `Remote App Url` in the output URLs.  ðŸŽ‰


| URL               | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local App Url      | The local link for your App\.                                                                                     |
| Remote App Url     | The online link to your App\. It will be always synced with the local Url                                         |
| Webhook Url        | The Url link that connects your App with any action may happen at the Merchant store, e\.g\. create new product\. |
| OAuth Callback Url | The App entry page where the access token generated                                                               |


<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Configure Authorization Modes <span id='auth-modes'>

While creating your App in the [Salla Partners Portal](https://salla.partners/), you will see that Salla provids two methods for the OAuth protocol, which are the `Easy Mode` and the `Custom Mode`.
    
> During the setup process, the default _OAuth protocol_ will be set to the `Easy Mode`, which can be configured from the file [`.env`](.env).
> All of the setup's values/keys are stored in the `.env` file as we can see in the below image.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TvSCAWC.png" width="660" alt="Salla Laravel App folder structure"></p>

#### Easy Mode:
    
This mode is the default mode for the authorization, which means that the `access token` is generated automatically at Salla's side back to you.
You may refere to the class [`StoreAuthorize`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php#L18) which is defined inside [`app\Actions\App\StoreAuthorize.php`](app/Actions/App/StoreAuthorize.php) to get more detailes on how to receive and manage the `access token`

    
#### Custom Mode:
    
A callback Url is the Url that is triggered when the App has been granted authorization. This should be a valid Url to which the merchant's browser is redirected. In this mode, you will need to set a custom callback url from the App dashboard at the [Salla Partner Portal](https://salla.partners/). This callback url will redirect the merchants who are interested in using your app into your App entry page where the access token generated.

You may refere to file [`app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php) which contains the [`callback()`](app/Http/Controllers/OAuthController.php#L26) function. This function is responsiable for generating the `access token`

> The custom url will redirect the merchant to the [Store Dashboard](https://s.salla.sa/apps) in order to access the Store where he needs your App to be installed.

TODO
- Token refresh().

## Usage

- Upon installation, your Laravel App home page will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You need to start with doing _Login_.
- Login to the Laravel App with the demo account:
  >  Email:  `awesome@salla.dev`
  >  Password:  `in ksa`
- Click the button to request the _Access Token_.
- The Laravel App will redirect you to Merchent Auth Page.
- Login using a Merchent Account.
- Give the access to your Demo App.
- The browser will redirect your again to Laravel App.
- Setup the callback url on Salla Partner Portal to http://127.0.0.1:8000/oauth/callback

<!-- Webhooks -->
## Webhooks
[Webhooks](https://docs.salla.dev/docs/merchant/ZG9jOjI0NTE3NDg1-webhook) simplify the communicate between your App and [Salla APIs](https://docs.salla.dev/). In this way, you will to be notified whenever your app receives payload/data from the Salla APIs. These webhooks are triggered along with many actions such us an order or product is created, a customer logs in, a coupon is applied, and much more.

Salla already defined a list of the webhooks/actions that are triggered automatically. The predefined webhooks/actions can be found in folder [`app/Actions`](https://github.com/SallaApp/Laravel-Start-Kit/tree/master/app/Actions).
